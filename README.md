RECOMMENDATIONS

After running a comprehensive analysis on the dataset and coming up with some observations, the following are the recommendations that I came up with:

    1.      Optimize inventory costs, total cost of items should be analyzed ad reduced.
    
    2.      Prioritize high value orders, this would help to maximize revenue.
    
    3.      Invest in marketing and expansion in top – performing regions.
    
    4.      Develop new item types to reduce dependence on single products.
    
    5.      Come up with strategies to bring about more increase in sales in low – performing regions.
    
    6.       Monitor sales trends to anticipate seasonal fluctuations.
